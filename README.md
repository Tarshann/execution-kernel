# Execution Kernel

The Execution Kernel is a deterministic governance layer for autonomous systems.

It enforces policy evaluation, risk classification, capability isolation, approval gates, and execution traceability across agent-driven workflows.

As autonomous agents become more capable, execution without governance becomes increasingly dangerous. Creation is becoming cheap. Trust is not.

The Execution Kernel exists to provide deterministic enforcement in environments where probabilistic decision-making is insufficient.

This repository defines the architecture, principles, and phased implementation plan for a model-agnostic, agent-agnostic execution control layer.
